# Cellular-Vehilce-to-Infrastructure-C-V2I
Cooperative resource management for C-V2I communications in a dense urban environment, Vehicular Communications, 2020

This paper provides how cellular communication can be used for V2X communication. It provides the complete implementation of V2I communication according to the 3GPP Rel. 14 and 15. 
Cellular-based vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) is one of the emerging and promising techniques to support vehicular communications by enabling both safety-critical and non-safety services. C-V2X
communications is a core solution to manage and advance future traffic safety and mobility. In this paper, we design a cellular-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications model for a Manhattan-dense urban environment that has many roads deployed in the cell edge region and many cellular base stations. We provide the results in outage probability, throughput, and vehicle received interference. 


The research project has been published in vehicular communication, Elsevier (IF: 6.7).
